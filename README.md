This repo was made for an internship at University of Pacific where I was tasked to differentiate horse, dog, and human hair samples by analyzing peptides with a MALDI-TOF machine. During the first week of this nine-week internship, I realized a Machine Learning Model could be used to predict what species a hair sample originated from which would save time from analyzing each MALDI plate well. Thus, I programmed a python program that extracted m/z and intensity values from a .csv file that the MALDI-TOF produced into an excel sheet. With this data, I trained a machine learning model I programmed with Random Forest, scikit-learn, and Python to predict which species a hair sample originated from based on m/z and intensity values.
